  interview: `Sam runs a custom cabinet shop with 15 employees. He started the business 10 years ago and has grown it through word of mouth and quality work. He's frustrated because he uses 7 different apps to run his business - QuickBooks for accounting, Mailchimp for email, a spreadsheet for leads, another for scheduling, and so on. None of them talk to each other.

"I just want one place where I can see everything," Sam says. "My wife handles the books, I handle the customers, and my shop foreman handles production. But we're always asking each other 'did you update the spreadsheet?' or 'what's the status on the Johnson job?'"

Sam tried a big CRM once but gave up after a week. "It wanted me to fill out 50 fields just to add a customer. I don't have time for that." He values simplicity and personal support. "If I have a question, I want to call someone and get an answer, not read a 20-page help article."

His ideal solution would feel like having a smart assistant who already knows his business and can guide him without making him feel stupid.`,
